# MathStat474
Welcome to Math 474 @ IIT by Sonja PetroviÄ‡. 
The section numbers in the tables below refer to the following course textbook:  *Walpole, Meyers, Meyers, Ye:  Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists*, 9th edition.

### Important dates

* **Midterm** will take place in class on Wednesday March 6th. **Midterm exam topics:** everthing up to and not including the intro to continuous random variables!  [Scheduled make-up midterm exams will take place Monday after spring break, in my office RE-208, at 11:25am.] The midterm will be graded within one week, and so you will be able to see your grades by 3/13. But the physical exams may not be returned until 3/20. 

* **Final exam** will take place on Monday, April 29th, 10:30am-12:30pm at PH108. The exam will be comprehensive, with 2/3 of the topics from after the midterm, and 1/3 before the midterm!

#### Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk1, day1: Research questions, population, sample, sample space with notation, data, data collection mechanisms, types of data. Where does randomness come from (I am not random!)? How data are generated. 
* wk1, day2: "*the big picture*" relating probability to inference; examples of studies and conclusions. Why is it important to quantify the uncertainty (e.g., "with 95% confidence we conclude that 65% of the US adult population favors X...") Sent (on Slack)  a data set to try to see a pie chart or a bar chart. Begin to think about how data are usually summarized graphically: visualization of a categorical variable. 
* wk2, day1: holiday [no class].
* wk2, day2: Histograms - visualizing distributions for quantitative variables. (Remember, we talked about boxplots for discrete variables in week 1.) Interpreting histograms. Measures of center and beginning to think about measures of spread (e.g. range). 
* wk3, day1: How do you summarize "data spread"? Think about the histograms we saw in week 2. How you do detect an outlier? 
   * Also included: a pop-up 'quiz' on boxplots! [low stakes - participation credit for *any* answer!]
* wk3, day2: Wrapping up standard deviations as a measure of variability in the data. Formal introduction to probability: meaning, notation, likelihood, and computation using relative frequency of an event in a sample space. Empirical computation of probability & the Law of Large Numbers. 
* wk4, day1: Beginning of theoretical computations of probability: equally likely outcomes, sample spaces and events, and basic probability rules (complement rule, general addition rule, disjoint events). 
* wk4, day2: finished up multiplication rule, discussed independent events, and talked about using given probabilities for two categorical variables to construct a two-way probability table, including the marginal totals. 
* wk5, day1: conditional probability: definition and computation. Independence events and 4 equivalent ways to testing independence. 
* wk5, day2: probability trees, the rule of total probability, and the Bayes rule. 
* wk6, day1: the concept of random variables, discrete vs. continuous. Probability distribution, rules and how to compute it. Means of random variables: meaning and use. 
* wk6, day2: Rules for means and variances of random variables. Standard deviation and meaning. Relating back to the law of large numbers and outliers discussion from week 3. 
* wk7, day1: Binomial random variables: how do they arise? what is the 'binomial experiment'? How to compute the probability distribution of a binomial random variable? mean and variance formula.
* wk7, day2: Multinomial random variables (generalizing binomial) and the corresponding experiment, example to recognize in application. Hypergeometric distribution and acceptance sampling, with example. 
* wk8, day1: Poisson random variables and the Poisson process. Approximation to Binomial for $n\to\infty$ and $p\to0$.  Intro to continuous random variables: what is a probability density function? (relate to histogram of a discrete r.v.) Example of shoe size vs. foot length. The normal random variable, and the standard deviation rules for the normal. Why density, not just "a probability distribution"? Probability of being in an interval using the density curve leads to integrals. 
* wk8, day2: But what is the *integrand* above? Normal density formula. Standard normal: why? ("how many stdevs away from the mean?") Applications and examples using the normal calculations and standard normal $z$-scores. 
* wk9, day1: wrap up any remaining examples from above. 
* wk9, day2: midterm exam.
* wk10, day1: after spring break we continue with applications of the normal distribution: approximation and binomial. Our first real large-sample theorems. Statistical inference, here we come! :)  Also we will introduce the uniform distribution which we skipped before the break. 
* wk10, day2: wrapping up probability and intro to statistical inference. Returning the midterm exam (graded) for those students who did not pick it up on Monday from my office. 
* wk11, day1: sampling distribution of the sample mean. The Central Limit Theorem. Application / example. 
* wk11, day2: summary of probability (all we have learned!); intro to inference. Three types of statistical inference. Point estimation and unbiased estimators. 
* wk11, day1: Confidence intervals for population mean. Meaning of confidence interval and interpretation. What to do when population variance is unknown. The common form of normal confidence interval: estimator plus/minus margin of error, computed using the estimator's variance! 
* wk11, day2: confidence interval for population proportion. what's that estimator in the center of the confidence interval? -- brief overview of MLE!
