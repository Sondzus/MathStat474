# MathStat474 - HW 11

> Posted Nov 5. **Due: WED Nov 12.** 

Remember to always explain your answers. 

### Problem 1. [this is about conficendce intervals and margin of error]

* What sample size of U.S. adults do you need, if you would like to estimate the proportion of U.S. adults who are "pro-choice" with a 2.5% margin of error (at the 95% level)?
* Your answer to the above question indicates that if you take a sample of that size, the sample proportion of adults who are pro-choice is (select one):
    * more than 2.5% away from the proportion who are pro-choice among all U.S. adults.
    * within 2.5% of the proportion who are pro-choice among all U.S. adults.
    * exactly equal to the proportion who are pro-choice among all U.S. adults.
    
* If you were to use a random sample of size n = 640 U.S. adults (instead of what you found in question 1), what would the margin of error roughly be?
    * 4%
    * .156%
    * 3%
    * 5% 

### Problem 2. [problem 9.37 in the book]

A study was conducted to determine if a certain treatment has any effect on the amount of metal removed in a pickling operation. A random sample of 100 pieces was immersed in a bath for 24 hours without the treatment, yielding an average of 12.2 millimeters of metal removed and a sample standard deviation of 1.1 millimeters. A second sample of 200 pieces was exposed to the treatment, followed by the 24-hour immersion in the bath, resulting in an average removal of 9.1 millimeters of metal with a sample standard deviation of 0.9 millimeter. Compute a 98% confidence interval estimate for the difference between the population means. Does the treatment appear to reduce the mean amount of metal removed?

### Problem 3. [problem 9.41 in the book]

The following data represent the length of time, in days, to recovery for patients randomly treated with one of two medications to clear up severe bladder infections:

| Medication 1: | Medication 2:  | $\quad$ | $\quad$ |$\quad$ |$\quad$ |$\quad$ |
| ---- |  ---- | ----|----|----|----|----|
| $n_1=14$ | $n_2=16$ ||||||
| $\bar{x_1}=17$ | $\bar{x_2}=19$ | |||||
| $s_1^2=1.5$ | $s_2^2=1.8$ | |||||

Find a 99% confidence interval for the difference $\mu_2-\mu_1$ in the mean recovery times for the two medications, assuming normal populations with equal variances.


### Problem 4.   [problem 9.104 in the book]

Consider Review Exercise 9.103. Let us assume that the data have not been collected yet and that previous statistics suggest that σ1 = σ2 = \$4000. Are the sample sizes in Review Exercise 9.103 sufficient to produce a 95% confidence interval on $\mu_1=\mu_2$ having a width of only \$1000? Show all work.

### Problem 5 [Extra credit] 
Choose either problem 9.81 or 9.85 from the book: 

9.81. asks for an MLE for $p$ in a Bernoulli process; 9.85 asks for an MLE for $\theta$ in a uniform distribution.
