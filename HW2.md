## Problem 1

 Solve exercise 1.2 in the textbook

## Problem 2.

Solve exercise 1.3 in the textbook. 

## Problem 3. 

Compute the range of the data, sample variance, and sample standard deviation in exercises 1.2. 

## Problem 4.

Solve exercise 1.9 in the textbook. 

## Problem 5. 

This problem is about visualization of distributions & interpretation of histograms.

In the workplace, depression is a leading cause of absenteeism and loss of productivity (Greenberg, et al. 1993). To assess the degree to which people suffer from depression, prior to receiving treatment, data were collected on the number of days that 105 patients were depressed prior to starting a new treatment. These data are displayed in the following table and histogram:



|Days|Count| 
|-----------|----|
| [20–60]   | 5  |   
| [60–100]  | 10 |   
| [100–140] | 20 |   
| [140–180] | 30 |   
| [180–220] | 16 |   
| [220–260] | 10 |   
| [260–300] | 6  |   
| [300–340] | 4  |   
| [340–380] | 2  |  
| [380–420] | 0  |   
| [420–460] | 0  |   
| [460–500] | 0  |   
| [500–540] | 2  |

* Using this same histogram of 105 patients, which of the following is most likely to be true? **Explain your answer.** 
  
  a. The mean will be larger than the median.
  b. The median will be larger than the mean.
  c. The mean and median will be about the same.

  a. 13
  b. 23
  c. 24
