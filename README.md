## Weekly schedule 

| Topics | Reading| Homework | 
|----| ----| ---| 
| **Weeks 1 & 2** | || 
|  **Introduction to basics**  <br> Research questions <br> Populations, samples, and data collection <br> Sample spaces and types of data <br> Summarizing quantitative data graphically | Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, parts of 1.6, 1.7. Section 2.1.|  [Homework 1](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW1.html) is due week 2, day 2 [Wed 1/17].  <br> [Homework 2](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW2.html) is due week 3, day 2 [Wed 1/24]. |
| **Week 3** | || 
|  Basics of EDA:  measures of spread in the data: range, quartiles, IQR, standard deviation, and what they all mean for data summaries and statistics.  Also we will go over the construction and interpretation of boxplots. <br> Introduction to probability. | Sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.1, 2.2, 2.4. |  [Homework 3](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW3.html) is due week 4, day 2 [Wed 1/31]. |
| **Week 4** | || 
|  Introduction to probability: sample spaces and events, equally likely outcomes, and basic rules of probability. | Sections 2.4, 2.5. Read through 2.3 as extra. |[Homework 4](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW4.html) is due week 5, day 2 [Wed 2/7].  |
| **Week 5** | || 
| During the week, at some point, we will discuss counting (see section 2.3!). <br> Conditional probability and independence; the general multiplication rule; probability trees. The law of total probabilty and Bayes' rule. | Please read section 2.3 carefully, and study the formulas in there, as you will likely need to use them for homework!<br> Sections 2.6 and 2.7. | Homework 5 will be posted by end of day on 2/7. |
| **Week 6** | || 
| Random variables: discrete random variables. | | | 

#### Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk1, day1: Research questions, population, sample, sample space with notation, data, data collection mechanisms, types of data. Where does randomness come from (I am not random!)? How data are generated. 
* wk1, day2: "*the big picture*" relating probability to inference; examples of studies and conclusions. Why is it important to quantify the uncertainty (e.g., "with 95% confidence we conclude that 65% of the US adult population favors X...") Sent (on Slack)  a data set to try to see a pie chart or a bar chart. Begin to think about how data are usually summarized graphically: visualization of a categorical variable. 
* wk2, day1: holiday [no class].
* wk2, day2: Histograms - visualizing distributions for quantitative variables. (Remember, we talked about boxplots for discrete variables in week 1.) Interpreting histograms. Measures of center and beginning to think about measures of spread (e.g. range). 
* wk3, day1: How do you summarize "data spread"? Think about the histograms we saw in week 2. How you do detect an outlier? 
   * Also included: a pop-up 'quiz' on boxplots! [low stakes - participation credit for *any* answer!]
* wk3, day2: Wrapping up standard deviations as a measure of variability in the data. Formal introduction to probability: meaning, notation, likelihood, and computation using relative frequency of an event in a sample space. Empirical computation of probability & the Law of Large Numbers. 
* wk4, day1: Beginning of theoretical computations of probability: equally likely outcomes, sample spaces and events, and basic probability rules (complement rule, general addition rule, disjoint events). 
* wk4, day2: finished up multiplication rule, discussed independent events, and talked about using given probabilities for two categorical variables to construct a two-way probability table, including the marginal totals.
