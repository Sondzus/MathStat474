# MathStat474
Welcome to Math 474 @ IIT by Sonja PetroviÄ‡. 
The section numbers in the tables below refer to the following course textbook:  *Walpole, Meyers, Meyers, Ye:  Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists*, 9th edition.

## Weeks 1 & 2 

| Topics | Reading| Homework | 
|----| ----| ---| 
|  **Introduction to basics**  <br> Research questions <br> Populations, samples, and data collection <br> Sample spaces and types of data <br> Summarizing quantitative data graphically | Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, parts of 1.6, 1.7. Section 2.1.|  [Homework 1](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW1.html) is due week 2, day 2 [Wed 1/17].  <br> [Homework 2](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW2.html) is due week 3, day 2 [Wed 1/24]. |


Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk1, day1: Research questions, population, sample, data, data collection mechanisms, types of data. Where does randomness come from (I am not random!)? How data are generated. 
* wk1, day2: "*the big picture*" relating probability to inference; examples of studies and conclusions. Why is it important to quantify the uncertainty (e.g., "with 95% confidence we conclude that 65% of the US adult population favors X...") Sent (on Slack)  a data set to try to see a pie chart or a bar chart. Begin to think about how data are usually summarized graphically: visualization of a categorical variable. 
* wk2, day1: holiday [no class].
* wk2, day2: Histograms - visualizing distributions for quantitative variables. (Remember, we talked about boxplots for discrete variables in week 1.) Interpreting histograms. Measures of center and beginning to think about measures of spread (e.g. range). 

## Week 3 

| Topics | Reading| Homework | 
|----| ----| ---| 
|  We will continue to discuss the basics of "the big picture": <br> measures of spread in the data: range, quartiles, IQR, standard deviation, and what they all mean for data summaries and statistics.  Also we will go over the construction and interpretation of boxplots. | The remaining sections of Chapter 1 in our textbook. |  Homework 3 will be posted by Wed. |

Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk3, day1: How do you summarize "data spread"? Think about the histograms we saw in week 2. How you do detect an outlier? 
* wk3, day1: pop-up quiz on boxplots! [low stakes - credit for any answer!]
* wk3, day2: tbd
