# MathStat474
Welcome to Math 474 @ IIT by Sonja Petrović. 
The section numbers in the tables below refer to the following course textbook:  *Walpole, Meyers, Meyers, Ye:  Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists*, 9th edition.

### Important dates

* **Midterm** will take place in class on *date tbd*. 
**Midterm exam topics:** everything up to and not including the intro to continuous random variables!  The midterm will be graded within one week, and so you will be able to see your grades by x/xx. But the physical exams may not be returned until x/xx. 

* **Final exam** will take place on *Thursday, December 11, 2-4pm* at our regular classroom HH005. The exam will be comprehensive, with 2/3 of the topics from after the midterm, and 1/3 before the midterm!

#### Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk1, day1: Research questions, population, sample, sample space with notation, data, data collection mechanisms, types of data. Where does randomness come from (I am not random!)? How data are generated. 
* wk1, day2: "*the big picture*" relating probability to inference; examples of studies and conclusions. Why is it important to quantify the uncertainty (e.g., "with 95% confidence we conclude that 65% of the US adult population favors X...") Sent (on Slack)  a data set to try to see a pie chart or a bar chart. Begin to think about how data are usually summarized graphically: visualization of a categorical variable. 
* wk2, day1: Histograms - visualizing distributions for quantitative variables. (Remember, we talked about boxplots for discrete variables in week 1.) Interpreting histograms. Measures of center and beginning to think about measures of spread (e.g. range). How do you summarize "data spread"? Think about the histograms we saw in week 2. How you do detect an outlier? 
* wk2, day2:  Wrapping up standard deviations as a measure of variability in the data. Introduction to probability: sample spaces and events, equally likely outcomes, and basic rules of probability. Formal introduction to probability: meaning, notation, likelihood, and computation using relative frequency of an event in a sample space. Empirical computation of probability - quick overview.
* wk3, day1: Labor Day holiday [no class].
* wk3, day1&2: Beginning of theoretical computations of probability: equally likely outcomes, sample spaces and events, and basic probability rules (complement rule, general addition rule, disjoint events).  Finish  multiplication rule, discussed independent events, and talked about using given probabilities for two categorical variables to construct a two-way probability table, including the marginal totals. 
* wk4, day1: finished up multiplication rule, discussed independent events, and talked about using given probabilities for two categorical variables to construct a two-way probability table, including the marginal totals. 
* wk4, day2: Finish second example of probability table. (relevant for HW!) 
Conditional probability: definition and computation. Independence events and 4 equivalent ways to testing independence. 
* wk5, day1: discussed more on computation of conditional probabilities and started talking about the Bayes rule. 
* wk5, day2: derived the Bayes rule and talked more about the example of the lie detector (lies vs. spies in a company example!). Started introduction to discrete random variables and their mean. 
* wk6, day1: meaning and formula of mean, same for variance/standard deviation. Comparing two distributions. Linear transformations of random variables. Definitions of PMF and CDF for a discrete random variable.
* wk6, day2: we will continue with discrete r.v. and two particular examples! 
* wk7, day1: Poisson. Recalling defn. of mean, interpretation of mathematical expectations, both for discrete and continuous random variables, and general functions of r.v.s.

<!-- note for future semester: should have done this after doing the linear transformations g(X)=aX+b... --> 

* wk7, day2: Continuous distributions, pdf, cdf, means, variance. Formal functions of random variables, expectations. Introduction to the normal distribution, and the standard deviation rule (and why it holds).
* wk8, day1: Wrapping up the normal distribution, standard normal values and computation, normal approximation to the binomial. Uniform distribution. 
* wk8, day1: midterm exam. TOPICS: everything up to but not including the continuous distributions! 
* wk9, day1: fall break day. 
* wk9, day2: Wrapping up the main concepts behind random variables that we didn't cover yet: joint distributions, marginals, conditionals. We did one continuous and one discrete example, all from the book. read the rest of this secton! 
* wk10, day1:  mathematical independence. Also, two more special r.v.s: multinomial and hypergeometric distributions.  Then, onto stats... Regarding random samples in section 8.1: note that we already covered  ideas behind these concepts during the first few weeks. 
* wk11, day1: Recall that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is given by the Central Limit Theorem. Application / example. Summary of probability (what have we learned) and intro to inference. Three types of statistical inference. Point estimation and unbiased estimators. What does it mean to estimate a parameter for a population? Connecting the dots: estimators, statistics, parameters, means, and variances. 
* wk11, day2: Wrapping up last lecture's discussion with more examples. Intro to interval estimation. Confidence intervals for population mean. 
* wk12, day1: "Guessing" confidence intervals for proportions. Why is sample size typically around 1100 in popular media polls? (The minimum sample size necessary to achieve a 3% margin of error for population proportion confidence intervals!) 
* wk12, day2: One-sided confidence bounds for population mean. Two samples: estimating the difference between two means. (Confidence intervals, still.)
* wk13, day1: Basic steps for hypothesis testing: what is a hypothesis? H_0 vs. H_1 setup and practice. What is evidence in data? Why we never "accept the null", only reject or fail to reject: an example with gender equity. 
* wk13, day2: How do we weight the 'amount' of evidence in the data: different sample sizes but same percentage points - how to quantify? Back to the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and using this to compute the p-value. Difference between one-sided and two-sided alternative hypotheses.
