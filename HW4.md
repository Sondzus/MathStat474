# MathStat474 - HW 4

> Posted: Thu Feb 5. **Due: Thu Feb 12.** 

Notation: Please notice that our textbook uses the notation $A'$ for the complement of the event $A$. So when it writes $P(A')$, they mean $P(\mbox{not }A)$.


### Problem 1.

<!-- Solve exercise **2.46** in the textbook. (Counting outcomes: combinations and permutations.) 
Solve exercise **2.47** in the textbook. (Counting outcomes: combinations and permutations.) 
Solve exercise **2.48** in the textbook. (Counting outcomes: combinations and permutations.)

According to www.jointogether.com, in 2000, 87% of all suicides were committed by males, 56% of all suicides were
committed using a gun, and 10% of all suicides were committed by women not using a gun.
(We'll use M for suicide committed by a male, F[= not M] for suicide committed by female, and G for a suicide
committed using a gun.)
Which of the following is a correct representation of the given information in a two-way probability table?

### Problem 2. 


Researchers studied thousands of court cases. For each case, they recorded the jury's decision. In addition, they asked
the judge in each case how he or she would have decided the same case if there were no jury. In 67% of the cases the jury
voted to convict, in 83% of the cases the judge would have convicted, and in 19% of the cases only the judge would have
convicted.
Let A be the event "jury convicts"
Let B be the event "judge convicts".

Complete the two-way probability table of the same format as in the previous problem! 


<!-- 
\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
B & not B & Total &       &  \\ \hline
  &       &       & A     &  \\ \hline
  &       &       & Not A &  \\ \hline
  &       &       & Total &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
--> 


### Problem 3.

 Solve exercise **3.11.95** in the textbook. (Conditional probability, law of total probability.) 
 
 A batch of 500 containers of frozen orange juice contains 5 that are defective. Two are selected, at random, without replacement, from the batch. Let $A$  and $B$  denote the events that the first and second containers selected are defective, respectively.

(a) Are $A$  and $B$  independent events?
(b) If the sampling were done with replacement, would  $A$ and $B$  be independent?

### Problem 4. 

Solve exercise **3.11.109** in the textbook. (Conditional probability, law of total probability, and Bayes.) 

Customers are used to evaluate preliminary product designs. In the past, 95% of highly successful products received good reviews, 60%  of moderately successful products received good reviews, and 10%  of poor products received good reviews. In addition, 
40% of products have been highly successful, 35%  have been moderately successful, and 25%  have been poor products.

a) What is the probability that a product attains a good review?
b) If a new design attains a good review, what is the probability that it will be a highly successful product?
c) If a product does not attain a good review, what is the probability that it will be a highly successful product?


 <!-- Prove that $$ P(A'\cap B′)=1+P(A\cap B)-P(A)-P(B). $$
 --> 
 


### Problem 5.

**[This is not a required problem. Doing it will earn you up to 5 points of extra credit.]**

<!-- A class in advanced physics is composed of 10 juniors, 30 seniors, and 10 graduate students. The final grades show that 3 of the juniors, 10 of the seniors, and 5 of the graduate students received an A for the course. If a student is chosen at random from this class and is found to have earned an A, what is the probability that he or she is a senior?
-->

 Prove that $$ P(A'\cap B′)=1+P(A\cap B)-P(A)-P(B). $$

### Typing up work 

If you *want* to type up your homework, I suggest you don't use Microsoft Word or the like. You can get great formatted documents in Markdown! Check out the links below. 
But whatever you use, please make sure your submission is either a PDF document, a photo of the document, or a nicely formatted text document. 

Get familiar with professionally formatting documents using Markdown [here](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/DocumentFormattingGuidelines.html).
