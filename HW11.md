### Problem 1. 



### Problem 2. 

A poll asked a random sample of 1,000 U.S. adults, "Do you think that the use of marijuana should be legalized?" 560 of those asked answered yes.

a. Based on the poll's results, estimate p, the proportion of all U.S. adults who believe the use of marijuana should be legalized, with a 95% confidence interval.

b. Give an interpretation of the margin of error in context.

c. Do the results of this poll give evidence that the majority of U.S. adults believe that the use of marijuana should be legalized?

d. A similar poll was conducted 2 years ago, and reported the 95% confidence interval for p, the proportion of U.S. adults who believe the use of marijuana should be legalized, to be (.48 , .54). Do you think that the results of the current study (where the 95% confidence interval is (.53 , .59) provide evidence that the public opinion on the topic of legalization of marijuana has changed over the past two years?
