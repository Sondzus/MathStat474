Welcome to Math 474 @ IIT by Sonja PetroviÄ‡. 
The section numbers in the tables below refer to the following course textbook:  *Walpole, Meyers, Meyers, Ye:  Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists*, 9th edition.

## Weeks 1 & 2 

| Topics | Reading| Homework | 
|----| ----| ---| 
|  **Introduction to basics**  <br> Research questions <br> Populations, samples, and data collection <br> Sample spaces and types of data <br> Summarizing quantitative data graphically | Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, parts of 1.6, 1.7. Section 2.1.|  [Homework 1](https://sondzus.github.io/MathStat474/HW1.html) is due week 2, day 2 [Wed 1/17]. |


Main concepts / ideas: 

* wk1, day1: Research questions, population, sample, data, data collection mechanisms, types of data. Where does randomness come from (I am not random!)? How data are generated. 
* wk1, day2: "*the big picture*" relating probability to inference; examples of studies and conclusions. Why is it important to quantify the uncertainty (e.g., "with 95% confidence we conclude that 65% of the US adult population favors X...") Sent (on Slack)  a data set to try to see a pie chart or a bar chart. Begin to think about how data are usually summarized graphically: visualization of a categorical variable. 
* wk2, day1: holiday [no class].
* wk2, day2: coming soon.
